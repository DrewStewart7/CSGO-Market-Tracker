# CSGO-Market-Tracker
Tracks items listed on Skinport, a third-party CSGO item market


This was originally going to be something similar to FlipSnipe(another repo on profile).

This website has good security measures(cloudflare, $30B company) which prevent auto-purchasing items. However, we can still view the market and new item listings using websockets

I've removed all of the "secret" things from the code like webhooks and secret tokens. It won't work until you replace those.

Thank you for checking out my work
