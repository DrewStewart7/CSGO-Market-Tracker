# CSGO-Market-Tracker
Tracks items listed on Skinport, a third-party CSGO item market


This was originally going to be something similar to FlipSnipe, but for CS:GO, not Roblox (another repo on profile).

This website has cloudflare on certain requests, which prevents auto-purchasing items. However, we can still view the market and new item listings using websockets

I've removed all of the "secret" things from the code like webhooks and secret tokens. It won't work until you replace those. You can get them from your SkinPort account settings and discord channel settings.

Thank you for checking out my work
